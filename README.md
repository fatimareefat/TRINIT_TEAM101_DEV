# TRINIT_TEAM101_DEV


Our Problem Statement is DEV02, which calculates the carbon emission by a website and shows user the same in the form of an extension.
Our approach is to start with making an extension first while one of us works on the website which shows the data on carbon emission by the websites. 

We are researching about the algorithm for calculating carbon emission using data provided by Web Extension API which is the API we are going to use.
